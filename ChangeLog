Version 0.5.0 (molinaro)
  * default to being system dependent as we mostly install in /usr/lib64
  * default to NO_DIALYZE and NO_EUNIT when it's a wrapped project
  * add .xrl and .yrl files to dist
  * when using wrap_git_tag if it looks like a version number use that as
  the FW_PACKAGE_VERSION
  * if a wrapped package doesn't have a rebar.config link the central one in
  * support a --with_build_prefix argument to fw-init which if set to '1'
  (or really anything), add the ${BUILD_PREFIX} magic
  * support a --with_deps "dep1,dep2" argument which will add dependencies
  to FW_PACKAGE_DEPENDS
  * support a --with_build_deps "dep1,dep2" argument which will add
  dependencies to FW_PACKAGE_BUILD_DEPENDS
  * switch check to check-am so that reordering of directories works correctly

Version 0.4.7 (kenan.gillet)
  * fix make check after make clean
  * fix rebar dialyzer check

Version 0.4.6 (molinaro)
  * typo was maybe leading to the old erlang template being used sometimes

Version 0.4.5 (molinaro)
  * ignore .dialyzer_ok and make sure it's removed by maintainer-clean

Version 0.4.4 (molinaro)
  * git ignore was messed up

Version 0.4.3 (molinaro)
  * make dialyzer failing break builds

Version 0.4.2 (molinaro)
  * fixes for erlang 18

Version 0.4.1 (molinaro)
  * fixes for Centos7

Version 0.4.0 (molinaro)
  * better way to ignore deps is with a rebar.config.script

Version 0.3.3 (molinaro)
  * dependency on rebar back and I believe appropriately set

Version 0.3.2 (molinaro)
  * hard dependency on rebar is not working at the moment, so removing it

Version 0.3.1 (molinaro)
  * build deps seem off

Version 0.3.0 (molinaro)
  * recursively add priv and c_src directories
  * remove ebin directory during make maintainer-clean

Version 0.2.0 (molinaro)
  * check escripts to remove warning
  * actually include rebar as a dependency

Version 0.1.1 (molinaro)
  * track a fix from fw-template-erlang for debian systems

Version 0.1.0 (molinaro)
  * add dialyzer support to make check when rebar doesn't support dialyzer

Version 0.0.2 (molinaro)
  * add maintainer-clean which removes all symlinks and the origin checkout
  * better checks before building .app file
  * NO_DIALZYER and NO_EUNIT now control whether to turn off dialyzer or eunit
    with make check (these can be set to anything in the Makefile.am.local in
    the root of a project).

Version 0.0.1 (molinaro)
  * copy c_src verbatim, sometimes there's depth there
  * allow dialyzer to be skipped

Version 0.0.0 (molinaro)
  * initial version, works for some things, not others, but at least it mostly
  works
